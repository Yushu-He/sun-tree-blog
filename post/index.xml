&lt;p>What I opened:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Auto Minify
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Javascript&lt;/li>
&lt;li>CSS&lt;/li>
&lt;li>HTML&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brotli&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Early Hints&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I didn&amp;rsquo;t open &lt;code>Rocket Loader&lt;/code>, because it seems that my hugo theme has some errors with it when loading the left sidebar. You can try it and see whether it works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s all for this, see you next time~ :)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SJTU reopen!!!</title><link>https://sun-tree.ink/p/sjtu-reopen/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Sep 2022 22:33:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sun-tree.ink/p/sjtu-reopen/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://sun-tree.ink/p/sjtu-reopen/cover.webp" alt="Featured image of post SJTU reopen!!!" />&lt;p>SJTU is now gradually reopening!&lt;/p>
