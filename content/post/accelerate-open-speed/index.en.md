First, go to the dashboard-speed-optimization and you can see all the options there.

What I opened:

- Auto Minify
  - Javascript
  - CSS
  - HTML
- Brotli
- Early Hints

I didn't open `Rocket Loader`, because it seems that my hugo theme has some errors with it when loading the left sidebar. You can try it and see whether it works.

That's all for this, see you next time~ :)
